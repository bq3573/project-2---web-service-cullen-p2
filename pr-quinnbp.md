Brandon Quinn - Peer Review
1. I was able to reach all your endpoints using the URLS provides, as well as make requests and recieve respinses from them.
2. I like how you preseneted the report, that was a really smart way to display the functionality.
3. The paths are consistent and there really aren't and confusing parts about them.
4. They were pretty straight forward, organized, and easy to read.
5. The way we present testing for our endpoints is different and comes from our read me rather than using URLS from the report. I think both ways will work with a front end fairly easily. Our code bases are pretty similar too, you do seperate the create.sql from the schema.sql which we dont and probably should.
6. The code is well organized both in terms of file/folder structure but also in terms of the contents of the files.
7. A README file is always a good idea to add. Because I did the same project its generally easy for me to see what you were doing and how things work but at the same time for anyone brand new to your code or the project would most likely appreciate a readme.
8. Not too much to really critique with this project, the organization of the code itself is very good and the way things are presented in the report make things pretty easy to understand, follow, and test. The amount of data you show in my opinion is fine, but when there is a lot more data involved maybe set some sort of limit.
